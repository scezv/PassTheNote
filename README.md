# PassTheNote(NORD)
## _Simple Password and Notes Manager_
__PassTheNord__ is a simple password and notes manager android application made for our first Project Submission following lots and lots of YouTube's tutorials.
Midway through the project we changed the name form __PassTheNote__ to __NORD__ so I have no idea if the files here are managed properly or not.
But hey, Open-Source.

### Implementations
